🐍 Python Fundamentals – Extensive Practice Project 🐍 
This repository is part of a personal challenge to complete a vast collection of Python exercises focused exclusively on fundamental programming concepts.

🚀 Objective
To master Python from the ground up by practicing logic, operations, and problem-solving through pure code. This project will serve as the robust foundation for future Machine Learning and AI development.

🧱 Structure
The exercises are meticulously organized in folders, grouped by topic and increasing difficulty:

/variables_operaciones/ → arithmetic, conversions, basic math
/condicionales/ → if-else, logical conditions
/bucles/ → for, while, nested loops
/funciones/ → function creation and modularity
/listas_diccionarios/ → collections and data structures
/archivos/ → reading/writing files, data processing
